# Counting-syllables-using-Recurrent-Neural-Network
This is my individual final project in the class CS 111 (Discovering Computer Science: Scientific Data and Dynamics) at Denison University. The instructor of the class is Dr. Jessen Havill. 

For this project, I utilized a bidirectional LSTM algorithm to accurately predict the number of syllables present in a given word.
